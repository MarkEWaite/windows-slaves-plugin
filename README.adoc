Allows you to setup agents on Windows machines over Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

== Usage

Once the plugin is installed, a new launch type is available in the agent configuration.
Once the agent configuration is saved,
Jenkins will reconnect the agent using the plugin.

== How does it work?

This section goes into the details of how the managed Windows agent launcher actually works.

Jenkins uses multiple protocols to install the actual agent as a Windows service and then start it. These protocols have been around for a quite some time.

IMPORTANT: The installation process assumes that the JRE is installed and accessible on the agent. Please see link:docs/troubleshooting.adoc[Troubleshooting WMI Windows Agents] if you need further help.


* It first uses http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block[CIFS] (also known as "Windows file share protocol") to push files into the
agent. 
When used by someone with administrative privileges, Windows file shares expose what's commonly known as "administrative shares",
which are hidden exported directories that cover every drive in the system.
* It then uses
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Component_Object_Model[DCOM] to
talk to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Management_Instrumentation[WMI] to
install and start a service remotely.

== Troubleshooting
